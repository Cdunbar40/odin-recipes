    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Chicken Pineapple Stirfry recipe is quick and easy to make, and only requires a few ingredients.
        Ensure that you have a large wok handy, because in this house we cook in bulk. I don't really like 
        waxing poetic about food, so let's get into it. Side note: I am not a good chef - You've been warned.
